# Audio Commentary

This is the code for the front-end script that's used as part of the Audio Commentary solution. This tracks
playback on any YouTube video of your choice, including pausing, seeking and ending.

When you're done, simply copy/paste the ac.frames[] array to the backend in order to generate an MP3 file 
that includes silence at the bits you stopped at, and high quality audio directly extracted from the video.
